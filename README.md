# TwoSong
A simple ice-breaker, group game that mixes instruments, songs, and people.

--------
This project's goal is to increase my understanding and experience with Javascript. In an attempt to make the app as fast as possible, and continue to round out my Javascript experience, I am setting a goal of not using any jQuery on this site. As such, I am also stating a browser support of primarily Google Chrome but also the other main browsers. As for Internet Explorer, I am going for IE 11 and greater. I do not apologize for not even trying to support IE 10 and down (although I suspect IE 10 will still work).

## How To Play:
This game works best with groups of 8 or more people. While a little music knowledge can help, it is actually not needed, and the lack thereof can actually make it more interesting. What is needed is that most people know the songs that you choose to play.

Directions:

 1. Add 2 or more songs.
 2. Add 2 or more instruments.
 3. Add everyone's names.
 4. **Play!**
 
TwoSong will tell you what combination of people should play what instrument and what song. One of the chosen players will be selected to play the instrument. The other will obviously be the main singer. If the instrument chosen is not a wind instrument both players will sing. If the instrument is a wind instrument, such as a Trumpet or Harmonica, only the main singer will be able to sing.
